# Setting up a React Project with Vite and Tailwind CSS

## Step 1: Create a React project with Vite

Open your command prompt (CMD) or use the terminal in Visual Studio Code and follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired folder where you want to create your project.
   ```
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```

2. Run the following command to generate a new React project using Vite:
   ```
   npx create-vite@latest
   ```

3. When prompted, enter the name of your project.

4. Select the "react" template when asked to choose a template for your project.

## Step 2: Initialize Tailwind CSS

To set up Tailwind CSS in your project, refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions. Visit the Tailwind CSS documentation: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Project

Navigate into your project directory by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:
```
cd my-project
```

Replace "my-project" with the actual name of your project.

## Step 4: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

To open your project in Visual Studio Code, you have two options:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" > "Open Folder." Select your project folder and click "Open."

2. Alternatively, from your command prompt or terminal, run the following command:
   ```
   code .
   ```

This will open the project in Visual Studio Code directly.

## Step 5: Study the Folder Structure

Inside your project, you will find a folder structure similar to the following:

```
- my-project
  - src
    - components
    - pages
    - styles
  - public
  - package.json
  - ...
```

- `src`: This folder contains your React components and application logic.
- `components`: This folder is where you can create reusable React components.
- `pages`: This folder contains the individual pages or views of your application.
- `styles`: This folder is used to store your custom CSS or styling files.

Feel free to explore and modify these folders to suit your project needs.

# Step 6: Identifying Components for a Todo App

As you start building your Todo app using Tailwind CSS, it's important to have a brief idea about the different components you would require. Let's explore the components commonly found in a Todo app:

## 1. Navbar/Sidebar

A navbar or sidebar provides navigation and easy access to different sections of the app. It typically includes links or buttons to switch between views, such as the Todo list, settings, or user profile.

## 2. Todo List

The Todo list component is the central part of the app that displays the list of todos. Each todo item usually includes a checkbox to mark it as completed, the task description, and an optional delete button.

## 3. Todo Item

A single todo item represents a task in the Todo list. It consists of the task description, a checkbox to mark it as completed, and a delete button to remove it from the list.

## 4. Todo Form

The Todo form component allows users to add new tasks to the Todo list. It typically includes an input field where users can enter the task description and a submit button to add the task.

## 5. Filters

Filters help users to view specific subsets of their Todo list based on criteria such as completed tasks, active tasks, or tasks with a specific label. These filters can be implemented using buttons or dropdown menus.

## 6. Label Component

Labels are optional features that allow users to categorize tasks. A label component can be used to display and assign labels to individual tasks in the Todo list.

## 7. Empty State

The empty state component is displayed when the Todo list is empty. It provides a message or prompt to guide users on how to get started by adding their first task.

These are the core components commonly used in a Todo app. Depending on your app's requirements, you may also consider additional features like task editing, due dates, prioritization, or user authentication.

By breaking down the app into these components, you can approach development in a modular and organized manner, focusing on one component at a time.

Remember, Tailwind CSS provides utility classes that can be used to style these components efficiently and achieve a consistent design throughout your app.

In the next steps, we will dive deeper into each component and implement them in your Todo app.
